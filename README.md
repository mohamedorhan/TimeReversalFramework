# TimeReversalFramework

**A Unified, Symbolic, and Scientific Framework for Time Reversal in Classical, Quantum, and Entropic Systems — Inspired by William Sidis**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository presents a rigorous and symbolic time-reversal framework that models classical, quantum, and thermodynamic systems with reversibility, using first-principles mathematics, symbolic computation, and numerical simulation. The framework is inspired by William Sidis' conceptual philosophy of time and entropy.

It offers:

- Closed-form analytical derivations.
- Numerical validation using `scipy` and `numpy`.
- Simulation and visualization with `matplotlib`.
- A reproducible scientific paper with results and proofs.
